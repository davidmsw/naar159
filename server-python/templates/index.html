                        <p> Writing a Machine-To-Machine (M2M) application can be daunting.  The purpose of this tutorial is to step you through the setup of a Raspberry 
                            Pi&#174; & Camera, the PiFace Digital Module, BigPond&#174; Mobile Wi-Fi 4G router, and Remote Virtual Machine (VM). You are free to use any of the code that Telstra 
                            provides, and please suggest bug fixes where necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>Discussion and collaboration between teams is encouraged through the use of GitHub. Although it is important not to reveal your idea or solution, 
                            where there is group benefit (e.g. improvements to the collaborative code provided by Telstra) then the teams are urged to contribute. GitHub 
                            will be introduced later.
                        </p>
                        <p>This tutorial will help you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set up your Raspberry Pi&#174; and Camera;</li>
                            <li>Set up the PiFace Digital Module;</li>
                            <li>Get wireless connectivity working using a BigPond&#174; Mobile Wi-Fi 4G router;</li>
                            <li>Run the provided sample GPS client;</li>
                            <li>Set up a VM server.</li>

                        <p>The diagram below shows the elements you will interact with during this tutorial. </p> 
                        <ul> 
                            <li> The <b> Raspberry Pi&#174; </b> is a small computer which has standard I/O ports to allow you to connect external devices that you may 
                            need for your solution. The <b> BigPond&#174; Mobile Wi-Fi 4G </b> router provides wireless connectivity to transfer data. 
                            The BigPond&#174; Mobile Wi-Fi 4G router has an inbuilt GPS chip, which during this tutorial, we will use to acquire and transmit GPS data. </li><br> 

                            <li> A <b> VM server </b> inside Telstra's Cloud Innovation Centre running Linux, is provided to you to support your application being developed on the 
                            Raspberry Pi&#174;. In the example application, this VM server is configured to do two things:
                            <ol> 
                                <li> Receive GPS co-ordinates, and team name submitted via JSON requests from the Raspberry Pi&#174; </li> 
                                <li> Provide a complete list of GPS co-ordinates most recently received for each Raspberry Pi&#174; that has reported GPS data </li>
                            </ol> 
                            <p>These two functions make it possible for the server to provide a map illustrating the locations of each of the devices. This is 
                                provided using Google Maps, which is hosted on the <a href = "http://www.telstra.com/universitychallenge" target="_blank"> M2M Challenge website</a>.
                            </p>

                    <p>The Getting Started guide is written from the perspective of using a monitor and keyboard directly connected to the Raspberry Pi&#174;.  
                        Alternatively you might prefer to set up the Raspberry Pi&#174; remotely by SSHing to the device.   One advantage of the former approach is that 
                        losing network connectivity does not affect your ability to configure the device. This can be useful when starting out with the Raspberry Pi&#174;.  
                        If you do choose to set up your Raspberry Pi&#174; over SSH, you might like to skip ahead to <a href ="#section2.3">Section 2.iii:</a> Connect to the 
                        internet and refer to <a href ="#section8.1">Section 7.i </a> for SSHing information if required and to the Troubleshooting section at the end 
                    </p>
                    <p>During the pre-challenge period Telstra will provide support to teams to ensure they can complete the Getting Started guide, but no other technical support.  
                        Once the challenge commences on the 7th of April, additional technical support is provided.  Technical questions can be shared via GitHub or

                            We can start by using the preview command. Open <i>LXTerminal</i> and enter the following command. This gives us a 
                            five second preview of the video and can be used for positioning the camera.

                            The PiFace Digital is a digital input/output device that connects directly to the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) port on the 
                            Raspiberry Pi&#174 board. Itâ€™s capable of reading in eight digital inputs and out putting eight digital outputs that 
                            link to onboard LED. The first two outputs also switch two 20V 5A relays, which will gives a greater amount of 
                            flexibility when creating your solution.

                            To install, the PiFace Digital module simply sits on top of the Raspberry Pi&#174; connecting to the GPIO ports, as shown in the picture below.

                            To start using the PiFace Digital module, you can open either <i>IDLE</i> or <i>IDLE 3</i> off the desktop for writing and editing the 
                            programming code in python2 or python3 respectably. For this example we will use python3. So open the <i>IDLE 3</i> 
                            application on the desktop, and then under the <code>File</code> option at the top, click on <code>New Window</code>. You should now 
                            have two windows open. The window titled <i>Untitled</i> is your workspace. It is the document you will write and run 
                            your code in. The other window, titled <i>Python Shell</i>, is where the results and debugging information will be presented
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The guide will go through all the relevant lines in the programming code and show the finished product at the end of this 
                            section. We assume the user has some basic programming experience and python experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our first step is to import the PiFace Digital library into our workspace. So we begin by writing the line.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="gutter: false">
import pifacedigitalio as p
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            This line will import the PiFace Digital library and from now on we can use the letter <code>p</code> to reference it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next step is to initialize the Piface Digital Module. As we have a instance of the PiFace Digital library imported 
                            to this workspace as the letter <code>p</code>, we just enter the following.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="gutter: false">
p.init()
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            Our final step is about using either the <code>digital_read()</code> or <code>digital_write()</code> functions. With both functions, 
                            we can pass two real numerical variables through them corresponding to the <i>pin_number</i> (values of 0 to 7) and <i>state</i> 
                            (either 0 or 1). They both have the format <code>digital_read(pin_number, state)</code> or <code>digital_write(pin_number, state)</code>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the next example we will write a digital high or 1 to the first pin out or pin 0.   
                        </p>
                        <pre class="gutter: false">
p.digital_write(0,1)
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            To run the program, click on the <code>Run</code> tab at the top of the window, then click on <code>Run Module</code>.                        
                        </p>
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <strong>Note:</strong> You will notice that this will flip the contacts on the relay and turn on the LED. The contacts on relay k0 
                            and k1 are trigger by writing a high to output pins 0 and 1 respectively. Each output is hardwired to a corresponding LED, and when a digital high or '1' is written to the the output, its LED is also turned on.   
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The following example brings together all we have learned in this section. It will loop and turn on LED0 and switch the K0 relay for one second and turn it off for one second indefinitely.

						<p>To connect to your Raspberry Pi&reg; from the internet, you will need to determine your router's public (WAN) IP address; there are a few ways to determine the public IP address:
							<ol>
								<li> Go to admin GUI of the router and select Data Used tab then look against WWANIP (see section 7 iv e if you need to know how to access the admin GUI of the router) </li>
								<li> Complete section 7 iv d (Check  serial port with minicom) then while in Minicom type in AT command: AT+CGPADDR. This will present the router internet address for SSHing into. </li>
								<li> You can also use 3rd party services such as google (using "my ip" as a search term), or <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com">www.whatismyip.com</a>. </li>

                                <li>No GPS signal can occur due to the Raspberry Pi&#174; being in an area where it cannot see the GPS satellites. Please try moving

                                    then, relaunch the script. It is best to watch the output after the AT command <code> AT!GPSSATINFO? </code> to see if there are 
                                    any satellites in view. Once there is a satellite lock, it is expected a latitude and longitude result should follow this command.
                                <li> <i> tshark </i> is useful to see what data is being transmitted.   A typical command line for tshark is <i> tshark -i eth0 -n 
                                        port 80 </i> which shows all traffic on port 80 on eth0. 
                                </li> 
                                <li>An exception is thrown due to server being down. Your device is working correctly but the sever inside Telstra which is trying 
                                    to store your results is not accepting your HTTP POST request.  The best thing to do here is to email our

                    <p>You should avoid using the root account as your everyday account where possible.   The root account provides very little room for error - 
                    <code> rm </code> will successfully remove important files, and if a script you are developing goes awry, there is very little to stop it.   
                    Additionally, if you work from the server, it can be annoying to share a single user environment. 
                    An easy mitigation for this is to create an unprivileged user for each member of your group.   To do this, use the command <i>adduser</i>. 
                    The following is a transcript from creating a user tom as root. </p>
                    
                    <p>The Terminal will prompt you to enter in a new UNIX password and confirm it. Then well ask you for you details and to confirm it.</p>

                                Our references and explanation are relative to the use of Git, and more specifically GitHub.  You should feel free to choose 
                                your favourite version control system. If you do choose to use GitHub, bear in mind that repositories in non-paid accounts are 
                                typically publicly visible, and this may not be what you want. You may wish to look at the following

                            <p> We assume that you will have already been exposed to a version control system as part of your degree.  If not, you may wish to 
                                follow the <a href = "http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial" target="_blank">git tutorial</a>, which will assist you in understanding this widely 
                                used version control system.  The advantage of learning a system like this is that it greatly simplifies collaboration within your team.

                            then you will need to connect the Raspberry Pi&#174; to a router so it is possible to find the device's IP address.  
                            Once you have this it will be possible to SSH to the device.  Refer to Section 8.1: <a href ="#section8">Setup remote connection to

                <p><b>Q. How can I check whether my router still has connectivity?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>There are several ways to verify this including by logging into the BigPond&reg; router website <a href="http://telstra.4g" target="_blank">http://telstra.4g</a>. Alternatively, you could try loading up a website.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. Why is the device using the Telstra.extranet Access Point Name (APN)?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>We are using this APN because it provides a public IP address to your device.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. Will I always be allocated the same IP Address when I connect to the network?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>No, the IP addresses are dynamically allocated when you attach to the network. It is likely you will often get the same address, but this should never be assumed.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. One of the components of the kit is broken. What should I do?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>Start by heading to the support tab[insert link] and fill out the support form. Alternatively, send a email to the <a href="mailto:telstrauniversitychallenge@team.telstra.com">support</a> 
                    team. Be sure to detail the component that isn't working and the issue you are having and we'll be in touch shortly.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. What is the VM server Configuration?</b></p>
                <b>A. </b>The VMs are provisioned with the following configuration:
				<ul>
					<li>Intel CPU (2 Cores) @ 2.27GHz</li>
					<li>2GB of RAM</li>
					<li>20GB of disk space</li>
				</ul>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. I am having username/password issues with the VM server. What should I do?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>Contact us by either filling out the support form or emailing the <a href="mailto:telstrauniversitychallenge@team.telstra.com">support</a> team. We will reset the username/password 
                        for you.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. The Raspberry Pi&#174; power cycles or mouse does not respond properly. What's wrong?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>These issues can be caused by and insufficient power supply and/or large sudden power drain on the Raspberry Pi&#174;'s USB ports. Please ensure the power supply you are using 
                    can at least support a minimum of 1A. We also do not recommend inserting the wireless modem directly into the Raspberry Pi&#174;'s USB ports while it is powered as this can cause a sudden 
                    drain in power that can reset the Raspberry Pi&#174;. Where possible, we recommend using a powered USB hub to attach USB peripherals to the Raspberry Pi&#174;.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. Will the Telstra University Challenge utilise Telstra's 4G network?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>Teams will be provided with a Telstra 4G capable USIM and BigPond&reg; router, but teams will need to check the current Telstra coverage maps (located 
                        <a href="http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/coverage-networks/our-coverage/" target="_blank">here</a>) to check what coverage is in their area.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. Why is GitHub being used for in the M2M challenge?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>GitHub is being used for the code sharing where there is a common benefit for all universities - such as improving the code provided by Telstra.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. Can the Telstra GitHub account be used for managing our own University Challenge Code?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>No, this is public repository. If you store your code in the Telstra GitHub account, it will be visible to other people. We recommend you use your own GitHub account or an 
                    alternative tool to manage your M2M University Challenge development code. Please note that only paid Github accounts have private repositories.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. The keyboard configuration is wrong. How do I fix it?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>The default keyboard layout with the standard Raspberry Pi&#174; image is British layout. You will likely have to change this to a US layout for your keyboard to work properly. 
                    Please see See the following <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?=63&t=33864" target="_blank">forum</a> or watch the following 
                    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1F-TxTPyiM" target="_blank">video</a> guide.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Q. I can only connect a mouse and keyboard into the Raspberry Pi&reg;'s USB ports - is there no third USB port for the USB modem?</b></p>
                <p><b>A. </b>You will need to use a USB hub to increase the number of ports. We recommend using a powered USB hub. Another option is to remove the mouse and keyboard and connect remotely via 
                    SSH in the Raspberry Pi&reg; while the device is connected to a network via Ethernet or wireless.</p>
